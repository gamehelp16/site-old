Honestly I don't really know what to say for this second post, so I decided to put a music video for you to chill at night (if it's night when you're reading this anyway).

Also I want to see if I am able to embed some HTML code in the middle of a post.

<iframe width="630" height="354" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8jOQUsTU9o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="max-width: 100%;"></iframe>

While listening to some chill music, why not read a heated up comment by someone?

<div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="true" data-embed-created="2015-12-27T15:09:26.704Z"><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjb37ee">Comment</a> from discussion <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/">Reddit helps me focus on the important things...</a>.</div><script async src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"></script>

Have a nice day! :)
