[Monstercat](https://www.monstercat.com/) is an independent EDM record label based in Canada which releases a new track three times a week. Once Monstercat has released thirty tracks consecutively, a new compilation album is created containing these tracks and two continuous mixes of the album. On this project you can browse through these compilation albums.

Inspired by [/u/Bloq's Visual Tracklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/4m0t3q/monstercat_027_cataclysm_bloqs_visual_tracklist/) on Reddit, I decided to create a webpage version of the tracklist and added some more functionality into it. You can check out the project in action [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/monstercat-browser/).

{% include image.html
           img = "album-browser.png"
           title = "Monstercat Album Browser"
           caption = "The end of the world, is just the beginning." %}

On the site you can click tracks to play them right on that page, click the genre circles on the top right corner of the page to filter the tracklist by genre, and (of course) you can navigate through the albums.

The data of the albums are stored in JSON files inside the [/albums](https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser/tree/gh-pages/albums) folder, you can help with adding album data by going [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/monstercat-browser/albumdata.html).

Last but not least, the GitHub Repo of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser). Thank you for reading.
