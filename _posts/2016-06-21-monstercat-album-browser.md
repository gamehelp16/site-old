[Monstercat](https://www.monstercat.com/) is an EDM record label which releases a new track three times a week. Once thirty tracks have been released, a new compilation album is created containing these tracks and two continuous mixes of the album.

Inspired by [/u/Bloq's Visual Tracklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/4m0t3q/monstercat_027_cataclysm_bloqs_visual_tracklist/) on Reddit, I made a site where you can browse through these compilation albums and you can check it out [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/monstercat-browser/).

{% include image.html
           img = "album-browser.png"
           title = "Monstercat Album Browser"
           caption = "The end of the world, is just the beginning." %}

On the site you can click tracks to play them right on that page, click the genre circles on the top right corner of the page to filter the tracklist by genre, and (of course) you can navigate through the albums.

The data of the albums are stored in JSON files inside the [/albums](https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser/tree/gh-pages/albums) folder, and you can help with adding album data by going [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/monstercat-browser/albumdata.html).

Last but not least, the GitHub Repo of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser). Thank you for reading!
