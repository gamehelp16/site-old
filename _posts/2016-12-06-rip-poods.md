Right now, [PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw) (the largest channel on YouTube) has around <span id="intro">49,710,256</span> subscribers and counting. On a video uploaded a while ago, he claimed that he's going to delete his channel once he reach 50 million subs.

So guess what? I made a site which helps you to keep track of his sub count and you can visit it right [here](https://gamehelp16.github.io/rip-poods/). The site features a live subscriber count, number of subscribers left until 50 million and a fancy progress bar.

{% include image.html
           img = "rip-poods-screenshot.png"
           title = "Screenshot of the site"
           caption = "Look at them subscribers!" %}

Is PewDiePie seriously going to delete his channel or is he just joking? I don't know, let's just wait and see.

<script>

window.onload = function() {
	updateCounter();
}

function updateCounter() {

	var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
	request.open('GET', 'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=statistics&id=UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw&fields=items/statistics/subscriberCount&key=AIzaSyAxoImyXMesvuFGzTBtgi1FsY7VWlgaAa0', true);

	request.onload = function() {
	  if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
	    var data = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
	    var subscribers = parseInt(data.items[0].statistics.subscriberCount);
	    document.getElementById("intro").innerHTML = numberWithCommas(subscribers);
	  }
	};

	request.send();

}

function numberWithCommas(x) {
    return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
}

</script>
